## What is Scala?
   * 'Scala' means Scalable Language. 
   * It's a Functional and Object Oriented Programming Language.
   * It's a Strongly Typed Language.
   * Started in 2001 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) by Martin Odersky.
   * Released publicly in 2004.

## Why learn Scala?

  * Better developer productivity.
  * More expressive language.
  * Better support for immutability.
  * JVM Based language (interoperability with Java).
  * Use existing Java libraries.
  * Good tooling and documentation.
  * Several cool features, such as pattern matching, for-comprehensions, traits, named and default parameters, etc.

## Isn't Java 8 enough?

  * Not a functional language by design.
  * More verbose.
